# My naive Contribution to the TidyTuesday Challenge

This are some of my naive contributions to [#TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). It is a weekly public project focusing on data manipulation/cleaning, and the creation of elegent, beautiful, and/or meaningful graphs/plots using `{ggplot2}`, as well as other packages in the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem. The project was founded in 2018 by [Thomas Mock](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/) and the [R4DS ("`R` for Data Science") online learning community](https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity). The intent of this repo is to include some of my creations using weekly datasets distributed by the project. These are really naive creations since I am using these datasets to practice data wrangling with `{dplyr}` and graphing in `{ggplot2}` alone. I do not claim any sort of causality or correlation from what I plot and no statistical analysis was/will be implemented.
